# Graph Algorithm

This project is about graph algorithms. Data structures that utilized is an adjacency list. This project programs to solve three problems, which are to check if the default graph is strongly connected, has a cycle, and compute the shortest path. The main graph functions in this project are add edge, delete edge, reset graph, random edge and print graph.

Implementation of the graph using adjacency list:
{('Tokyo', 'HochiMinh'): 4329, ('HochiMinh', 'Los Angeles'): 13135, ('Los Angeles', 'Asmara'): 14015, ('Prague', 'Asmara'): 4450, ('Tokyo', 'Prague'): 9073, ('Asmara', 'Tokyo'): 9961, ('Los Angeles', 'Tokyo'): 8811
